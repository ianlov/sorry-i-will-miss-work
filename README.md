Have you ever wanted to skip out on work, but struggled to find an excuse? Now you can find the perfect excuse for any workday absence with "Sorry I Will Miss Work".

"Sorry I Will Miss Work" will even create an email you can send to your boss that will surely explain the importance of your absence.
