I regret to inform you that I will not be at work on the 6th of October, 2021, because it is the very much celebrated World Cerebral Palsy Day. World Cerebral Palsy Day is an annual awareness observation that brings together people with cerebral palsy, their families and loved ones, and organizations working to ensure equal rights for them. I trust that you do not have any further questions about the matter.
